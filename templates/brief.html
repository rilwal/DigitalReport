<h1>Brief</h1>
<p>This document is the brief for my game. It contains the initial goals I had for the project, as well as the rationale behind them.</p>

<h2>The Issue</h2>

<p>Video games are a form of art. They can convey messages to a player in a way no other medium can because of their high level of interactability. A good game immerses the user in another world, then challenges them both mentally and physically. These challenges may vary from simple physical challenges such as quick reaction time testing, to challenging the player to make big decisions which may have a huge impact on the world they are invested in, challenging the players ethics and possibly affecting their view of the world.</p>

<p>The modern world moves quickly, and there is a lot of pressure on us all to perform well coming from all directions. Video games can provide a great escape from this busy world, providing people of all ages a place to go where they are free from their real life issues, if only temporarily. They help to releive stress, and are increasingly becoming the go to entertainment source for many people all over the world.</p>

<p>While there is no direct issue that means another video game is required, I feel that many modern games do not properly leverage the power of the medium, opting instead to use violence and quick satisfaction to attract players. I want to make a game which takes more from the player in terms of mental and physical challenge. That means that gamers will be able to have a more enriching, and ultimately more rewarding experience from the game compared to many other titles. While playing the game players should be able to hone their reaction times, work on their problem solving skills and memory, among other things.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Modern video games are becoming more and more about instant gratification: “Go here, kill this, you did good!” Case in point: <em>Call of Duty</em>. Call of Duty is an insanely popular game, with very little substance to it. The goal is simply to go and kill people. The characters and backstory are weak afterthoughts, and the game rewards players constantly. Got several kills? Have a reward. Won a game? Have some XP. The list goes on. In recent times there has been shown to be quite a big market for more skill based multiplayer games such as <em>Dota 2</em> or <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. This shows that users are intersted in games which require more time investment and skill, from which they can learn and grow.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Skills</strong>
			It is important that I have the skills required to make the game I decide to make: otherwise I will either be unable to make it, or the quality will be poor. This is why I think it is a good idea to do a 2D game. While I feel confident in my ablitly to program a 3D game, I am much less confident in my ability to do art assets such as 3D models and textures for such a game.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Time</strong>
			Any complex application is a large undertaking, which can use a lot of time. I am limited in the amount of time I can dedicate to this project with other school work, as well as personal projects and free time. This means that the complexity of the game will need to be relatively low to give me a good chance of finishing it.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Assets</strong>
			Creating a game requires a lot of work other than the technical aspects. I will be focusing on the technical side, but this is only a part of the whole picture. This means that my assessment will be mostly focused on the game engine, rather than the game as a whole. That is because this is being submitted for several technically focused assessments as well as the brief development one.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>The video game space is rather packed, and there are a lot of titles from which I can draw inspiration and find ideas.</p>
<h3>Thomas was Alone</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/">Thomas was Alone</a> is an indie puzzle platform game by Mike Bithell. It is based around the idea of a system which contains several self aware <abbr title="Artificial Intelligences">AIs</abbr> which are controled by the player. They are represented on screen as a series of various sized and colored quadrilaterals, each of which has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, for example one might be able to jump higher than others, while another may be able to float on water which is lethal to other cubes.</p>

		<caption>Later levels introduce the player to harder challenges, and they must control multiple ais to complete them</caption>
	</div>
</div>

<p>As you can see from these screenshots, the game starts out very easy: there is only one AI, the exit is right in front of the player and there is a helpful tutorial to guide the player through the game. The second screenshot shows a later level, where the AIs must work together to solve a puzzle using their respective abilities. In this case the purple AI had to jump on a high button to create the bridge you see there where the green cube could go across to get to the exit portal he is standing by.
</p>

<p>
The game was well received by critics and fans alike, receiving a 77 / 100 critic score, and an 8.1 / 10 user score on <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/thomas-was-alone">metacritic</a>, and was mostly praised for its great soundtrack and narration, as well as its good game design and "single player co-op" design.

	<h2>The Proposal</h2>
	<p>I propose that I will make a 2D side scrolling video game which aims to challenge the user on many fronts, from memory, to reaction time, to problem solving. I will perform market research to find the preferred genre and style of a range of gamers (my stakeholders).</p>
